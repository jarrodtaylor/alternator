# Alternator

Alternator is a CLI tool for building simple, static sites on your Mac.
It sits in the web publishing sweet spot between tedious hand coding and
heavy-handed frameworks.

You can use layouts, includes, and variables to create a static site
that doesn't need a server app to run or a frontend library to render.
